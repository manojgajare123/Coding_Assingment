Theoretical Challenge

//first we import the file using the following code 
public static void main(String [] args){
// this line import file from our system 
	List<Data> list= readCsvFile("file.csv");

}
public static List<Data> readCsvFile(String file){
// this line get the data from the file
   	Path source = Paths.get(file);
 // this line reads the data and get their ASCII values
   	BufferReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(source,Standard.Charsets.ASCII);
 // this line reads the data line by line
   	String line = br.readLine();
// this line stores the data until the last line 
   	while(line!= null){
   	String [] arr = line.split(",");
   	}
}

//After the reading code we have got the following issues.
// 1. there might be a chance of circular dependency error because in the formula A is dependent on C and C is 
//dependent on A so we use the setter dependency method to solve this problem.
